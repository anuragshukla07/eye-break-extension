# Eye Break Extension

A simple Chrome extension to help reduce screen time by reminding you to follow the 20-20-20 rule: Every 20 minutes, take a 20-second break to look at something 20 feet away. This helps reduce eye strain and promotes healthier screen habits.

## Features

- **Automatic Timer**: Starts a 20-minute timer once the extension is activated.
- **Toggle Button**: Start/stop the timer with a single click.
- **Color Indications**: Button color changes based on the timer state: 
  - Red: Timer is running (shows "Stop Timer")
  - Green: Timer is stopped/reset (shows "Start Timer")
- **Persistent Functionality**: The timer continues to run even if the extension window is closed, and it resets automatically after completing the 20-minute cycle.
- **Notification**: Reminds you to take a 20-second break every 20 minutes.
